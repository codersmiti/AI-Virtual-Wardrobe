5. Hairwig Try-On Module
Model Used:
UNet Architecture: Segments the face into five regionsâ€”hair, face, ears, neck, and shirt.
Facial Landmark Detection: Used on the segmented image to generate semantic maps.
Approach:
The system overlaps the source hair with the target face, creating a difference mask to fill in the missing sections using the SDEdit method. A smooth transition is achieved by filling in these sections using the fast marching approach.

6. Lipstick Try-On Module
Model Used:
Lip Landmark Detection: Dlib shape predictor.
Lip Detection: Haar cascade classifier.
Approach:
Detects lip region and applies different lipstick colors. The system then recommends various products based on the selected color
